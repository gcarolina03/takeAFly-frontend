# Take a Fly
Welcome to Take A Fly, a Travel Destination Search Platform! This platform allows users to search for travel destinations based on specific criteria such as date, budget, and interests. Users can create travel plans and choose whether they want them to be public or private. If a travel plan is public, other registered users can view and join the travel if their interests align and the dates are compatible.
